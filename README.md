# Visual Analytics project: help a football talent scout finding football players
The purpose of this project is to graphically help a hypothetical talent scout.

## Dataset
The dataset on which we want to base our project is "Football Manager Data", and can be
found here: [DataBase](https://www.kaggle.com/ajinkyablaze/football-manager-data). It contains
informations from the game "Football Manager 2017" i.e. several dozen of football player
features such as, for example: age, weight, height, kicking, corners, crossing, agility, jumping
and so on. We chose this dataset because Football Manager has been recognized by real-life
football clubs as a source for scouting players (Wikipedia) and therefore we think its data are
reliable and useful according our analytics. The dataset has 150,000+ football players (rows)
and more than 80 attributes (columns). For simplicity will keep only most important attributes
for the project and take only a subset of players.
